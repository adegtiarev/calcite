/**
 * The {@code GROUP_ID()} function.
 *
 * <p>Accepts no arguments. The {@code GROUP_ID()} function distinguishes duplicate groups
 * resulting from a GROUP BY specification. It is useful in filtering out duplicate groupings
 * from the query result.
 *
 * <p>This function is not defined in the SQL standard; our implementation is
 * consistent with Oracle.
 *
 * <p>If n duplicates exist for a particular grouping, then {@code GROUP_ID()} function returns
 * numbers in the range 0 to n-1.
 *
 * <p>Some examples are in {@code agg.iq}.
